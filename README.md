# Exercise ~ Attacking a kubernetes cluster

Welcome to this Dojo !
Your goal is to exploit this kubernetes cluster to understand the risks linked to a non secure cluster implementation, and learn the maximum during this session.

That's why it is essential that:

- You experiment and try things that may break. Don't simply copy paste everything from StackOverflow until it passes the test !
- To keep moving or learn more, please _andon_! It means then whenever you have a question, a doubt, a feedback, call someone from the staff, we'll love to help you.

## Setup your env

First, you need to setup your computer for the dojo.

Start with cloning this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/padok-team/dojo-terraform-aws-security
cd dojo-terraform-aws-security
```

### Connect to a distant VM

To work efficiently, you will work on a distant VM on which all the following tools are already installed.

- `git`: Version your code and collaborate
- [`aws CLI`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/cli): The CLI to interact with AWS.

To connect to the VM:

- Install VSCode
- Add the following [Remote SSH extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) to VSCode

- Create a github account
- Create a SSH key on your Github account: [Add a ssh key documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- Share your handle Github with Padok's team member

- Launch a "Remote SSH Session" with VSCode extension via the command `ssh cs@<handleGithub>.cs.padok.school`

### Bootstrap the environment

To create the insecure infrastructure, follow these steps:

```bash
chmod +x access-deployments.sh
./access-deployments.sh

```

## Let's attack it !
